This project makes use of the <b>FC2modHandler.dll</b>, which I made to support modtasks like unpacking/repacking patchfiles, getting indexes of setting-lines in <i>gamemodesconfig.xml</i> and writing new/extra values to supported settings. It also can work with the <i>FC2ServerLauncher.exe</i>.<br>
This dll is used in both FSL and this tool, but maybe future modders or tool creators could use it for other purposes.
